# Maintenance Policy

## Project Status

**Current Status**: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT  
**Maintenance Model**: Personal Open Source Project  
**Support Level**: Best Effort  
**License**: MIT (perpetually forkable)

## Commitment Statement

This is a personal open-source project maintained in my spare time. While I'm committed to keeping it secure and functional, users should understand:

- ⚠️ No commercial support or SLA
- ⚠️ No warranty or liability (see LICENSE)
- ⚠️ Updates based on personal availability
- ✅ Security issues will be prioritized
- ✅ Project can be forked at any time
- ✅ Zero dependencies minimize maintenance burden

## Maintenance Schedule

| Type | Response Time | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Security Issues** | 48-72 hours | Top priority, patches ASAP |
| **Critical Bugs** | 1-2 weeks | Breaking functionality |
| **Minor Bugs** | Monthly review | Non-breaking issues |
| **Features** | Quarterly | Evaluated for complexity |
| **Dependencies** | Monthly | Security updates only |

## Version Support

- **Current Major Version**: Full support
- **Previous Major Version**: Security fixes only (6 months)
- **Older Versions**: No support

## Bus Factor Mitigation

### Single Maintainer Risk Mitigation

1. **Full Documentation**: Everything needed to maintain is documented
2. **Zero Dependencies**: Reduces maintenance complexity
3. **MIT License**: Anyone can fork and continue
4. **Simple Codebase**: ~500 lines of TypeScript
5. **Standard Tools**: Uses common VSCode extension patterns

### Succession Planning

If I can no longer maintain this project:

1. **Immediate**: Add prominent notice to README
2. **30 days**: Seek community maintainer
3. **60 days**: Transfer to interested party or archive
4. **Always**: Existing versions remain available

### Knowledge Transfer

All critical knowledge is documented:
- Architecture decisions in code comments
- Build process in README
- Release process in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Security process in SECURITY.md

## End of Life Plan

If this project is discontinued, consider:
1. Building your own (it's only ~500 lines)
2. Forking this repository
3. Using online JSON anonymizers (less secure)
4. Writing a simple script

## Avoiding Hostile Takeover

### Protective Measures

1. **Personal Project**: Not accepting corporate sponsorship
2. **No Analytics**: Cannot track users for targeting
3. **No Infrastructure**: Nothing to compromise
4. **Zero Dependencies**: No supply chain to poison
5. **Account Security**: 2FA on all accounts

### Red Flags I'll Reject

- 🚫 Requests to add analytics
- 🚫 Requests to add network features
- 🚫 Requests to add dependencies
- 🚫 Offers to purchase the project
- 🚫 Requests for telemetry
- 🚫 Feature requests that compromise security

## Quality Commitments

### What I Guarantee
- Security vulnerabilities will be addressed
- Core functionality will remain working
- No malicious code will be introduced
- Project will remain open source

### What I Don't Guarantee
- Feature requests implementation
- Support response times
- Compatibility with future VSCode versions
- Long-term maintenance beyond security

## Contact for Maintenance

- **Security Issues**: See SECURITY.md
- **Maintenance Questions**: GitHub discussions
- **Transfer Inquiries**: Not accepting at this time

**Last Updated**: November 2025  
**Review Schedule**: Quarterly  
**Next Review**: Februrary 2026

## Commitment

I created this tool because I needed it. As long as I use VSCode and work with JSON, I'll keep it maintained. When that changes, I'll ensure a graceful transition or archival.
